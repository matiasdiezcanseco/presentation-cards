When working on tasks, check these documentation files only if the task relates to their specific topic:
- **General Context / New Features** -> `docs/project-overview.md`
- Auth/User Logic -> `docs/authentication.md`
- Database/Schema -> `docs/database.md`
- UI/Styling -> `docs/styling.md`
- Environment Config -> `docs/env-vars.md`
- Tech Stack Overview -> `docs/tech-stack.md`

## Feature Implementation Flow
**CRITICAL:** When implementing features, you must follow the sequential order defined in the `docs/features/` directory.
1.  Read the next pending feature file (e.g., `01-feature.md`).
2.  Implement the feature as described.
3.  Mark the feature as **[Completed]** in the markdown file.
4.  Proceed to the next feature.

Do not skip steps unless explicitly instructed.
